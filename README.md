# 42SH (MY_SHELL) #

This project objective is to replicate the functionalities of the tcsh shell. ‍

## Features: ##

* **Command Line Interface:** Interact with the system through a command prompt.
* **CHAT GPT BUILT-IN:** Interact with chat gpt directly through your shell using `gpt` command with bonus binary.
* **Builtin Commands:** Execute basic commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `exit`, and more.
* **Environment Variables:** Manage environment variables with `set`, `unset`, and `env`.
* **Command Arguments:** Pass arguments to commands for customization.
* **Redirection:** Redirect input (`<`) and output (`>`) of commands for file manipulation.
* **Pipes:** Combine commands using pipes (`|`) for data flow.
* **History:** Keep track of your old commands.
* **Globbing:** wildcard expansion in filenames. It allows you to match multiple files using patterns like * (any character) and ? (any single character).
* **Functional Test Generator:** easily generate functional tests using our bash test generator.
* **Job control:** Manage running processes (start, stop, background execution).
* **Aliases:** Often used to shorten a long or complex command.
* **Line Edition:** Edit and modify commands in the terminal before hitting enter.
* **Tab Completion:** Type faster and avoid typos by using auto-completion with `tab` key.

  
## Code & Build: ##

* **Language:** C
* **Compilation:** Compile using Makefile (`make`).
* **Execution:** Run the compiled executable (`./my_shell`).
* **Group Size:** 5
* **Project Duration:** 4 Weeks
